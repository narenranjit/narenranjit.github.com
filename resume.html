			<h3>Summary</h3>
			I'm a manager who loves solving problems. When I'm not programming, I'm typically leading agile development efforts on about 8 simultaneous projects for different clients operating on scrum principles. I believe my strength lies in always looking out for the bigger picture, and making sure the work I do drives the company forward. Pursuit of excellence should always trump maintaining the status quo and is a trait that I highly value in companies I work for.

				 		My role was to build user-interfaces for online simulations. Initially I was actually the only UI developer in the company, a position which came with great power and great responsibility. Besides designing and developing the simulations I was also responsible for orchestrating our efforts toward moving to a more streamlined development process.
